# MY REACT CHAT API (BACK)

To view it run, you need to fork and install my [kitten-box-app](https://github.com/alyson-b69/kitten-box-app)

## Installation :

- run npm install
- Create database on mysql (model on config/apichat.sql)
- create .env file (example on .env.default)
- run nodemon index

Then you can go on the react-chat-app and run npm-start (after initialisation)

### Nice to have

- [ ] socketIo : create a controller
- [ ] subscribe : create a better response for email and name check
- [ ] unsubscribe : create route for delete all the messages and the user who want to leave
- [ ] build tests
- [ ] deploy on my VPS with the front
